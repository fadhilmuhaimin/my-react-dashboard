This project is a basic React dashboard setup built with Vite, incorporating a clean architecture for handling state management, API calls, and UI components.

## Features

- **State Management**: Zustand is used for efficient state management with minimal boilerplate.
- **API Integration**: Axios is used for making API requests, with data being fetched from [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com) for demonstration purposes.
- **Charting**: Recharts is used for building interactive and customizable charts.
- **UI Components**: Ant Design (Antd) is used as the primary UI library for responsive and styled components.

## Tech Stack

- **React + Vite**: React is used as the front-end library, and Vite is used as the build tool for fast development.
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management library.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for API calls.
